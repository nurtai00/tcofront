      "description": "Tengizchevroil inherited an oil and gas separation plant when it took over operations at Tengiz in 1993. This first generation of the Tengiz plant is called the KTLs (Russian for Complex Technology Lines). TCO has invested in expanding and improving the KTLs over the life of the operation. Today, the KTLs consist of five oil and gas processing trains and are now significantly more efficient and environmentally friendly. Started up in 1991, KTL-1 consists of two trains and has the capacity of around 7,000 tons per day per train. KTL-2, which also has two trains with the same capacity was successfully completed and started up in 1996. Last KTL train 5 was put on production in 2001 along with first oil from Korolev field. The capacity of train 5 is around 11-12,000 tons, per day."

This expansion allowed TCO not only to double oil production in Tengiz, but also to improve the environmental performance and increase production efficiency. TCO completed the expansion in the third quarter of 2008, which brought daily capacity to 75,000 metric tons (600,000 barrels) of crude oil and 22 million cubic meters (750 million standard cubic feet) of gas. SGP stabilizes and sweetens crude oil, as well as separates and processes natural gas into gas products and elemental sulfur. SGP is the largest single sour crude processing train in the world."

The injection compressor is like no other compressor in the world and represents the state of the art in sour gas injection technology. SGI enables about 25% of total TCO oil production as well as pressure maintenance to reservoir."
