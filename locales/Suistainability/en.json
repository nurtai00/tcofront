TCO has already successfully diverted more than 50% of its waste to third party waste management facilities. To comply with updated regulatory requirements, in 2021 TCO has concluded agreements for collection, removal and recycling of construction, demolition and food wastes: food waste is processed by thermomechanical treatment to produce fertilizer and technical water as final products; construction and demolition waste is sorted into components with release of secondary materials for recycling.",

More broadly, TCO implements environmental protection program for the conservation of nests. Due to the successful implementation of bird nests management plans and timely response, almost 60% of the discovered nests were active and nesting ended with a successful chick hatch.",
        "Sturgeon Hatchery Support. As part of the project efforts, an Additional Conservation Action to support Ural-Atyrau Sturgeon Hatchery was implemented to achieve Net Gain for sturgeon. The aim of the program is to reduce the number of adult fish removed from the wild population each year and increase the percentage of wild caught broodstock that are returned to the sea. This is being done by improving the survivorship and productivity of sturgeon broodstock of the Ural-Atyrau Sturgeon Hatchery. The following efforts led to positive changes: the provision of high-quality feed for the broodstock and fry, aerators for oxygenation of rearing ponds, an excavator for external dredging work on the farm ponds. Additionally, TCO purchased and donated winter and summer water chillers for basins with closed water supply. As a result of the support provided to the Ural-Atyrau Sturgeon Hatchery, the sturgeon broodstock have shown an increase in weight.",
        "Ghost Net Removal Project. The project aims to prevent seals and fish from being caught in fishing nets by physically retrieving abandoned nets and to protect and contribute to the growth of endangered marine species such as the Caspian seal and sturgeon. As a result of the efforts of this project around 4300 kg of abandoned nets and 1000 kg of marine debris were collected in one season in 2021. Since 2014, 878 abandoned fishing nets (20 500 kg) and over 9000 kg of marine debris have been removed from the Caspian Sea, 53 sturgeons and 15 seals were freed from the abandoned nets."
