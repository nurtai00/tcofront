Показатель казахстанского содержания (КС) в проекте стабильно растёт: в 2021 году он составил 3,6 млрд долларов США. Это на 15% больше, чем в 2020 году.В целях создания условий для импортозамещения, ТШО определил 5 приоритетных товарных позиций для локализации, которые включают: запорную арматуру, фланцы/фитинги, сосуды под давлением, контрольно - измерительные приборы и электрооборудование. Также свыше 50 видов товаров и услуг были определены как имеющие высокий потенциал для производства внутри Казахстана. В течение 2021 года была завершена квалификация товаропроизводителей производящих высоковольтный кабель, оптико-волоконный кабель, ремонт низковольтных двигателей, сервис и инспекция газотурбин. В 2022 году проводится техническая квалификация казахстанских товаропроизводителей по таким продуктам, как кабельные лотки, шаровые краны, распределительные коробки, обтюраторы трубопровода, высоковольтные подстанции, ремонт/изготовление буровых сверл, пожарные машины и огнетушители.«Мы постоянно поддерживаем совместную работу с НПП «Атамекен», Ассоциацией 'Kazenergy', Союзом машиностроителей РК, Petrocouncil и KazService по работе с иницитивами развития казахстанского содержания», - отметил Даниэль Жолдыбаев, Директор по развитию казахстанского содержания, ТОО ТенгизшевройлДаниэль Жолдыбаев также отметил критерии, которые казахстанским компаниям следует совершенствовать: «Если говорить кратко, первое это соблюдение сроков – поставщику необходимо вовремя отвечать на запросы, второе это сертификация –  нужно соответствовать стандартам и иметь самые последние сертификаты, такие как ISO, API, ASME и ASTM, третье это технические и коммерческие вопросы - зачастую отсутствуют запрошенные данные, необходимо предоставлять полное предложение, четвертое это неконкурентноспособная ценовая политика – должно быть представление о рынке и конкурентах, чтобы тендерное предложение было конкурентноспособное, и пятый пункт это система управления качеством – а именно высококвалифицированный и сертифицированный персонал».Для улучшения данной ситуации ТШО в 2021 году провел серию обучающих мероприятий, такие как: курс подготовки к тендерам нефтяных операторов для поставщиков в котором было более 300 участников, курс «Внутренний аудитор интегрированных систем менеджмента», стандарты ISO 9001: 2015, 14001:2015 и 45001:2015, сертифицированный тренинг API, обучение Кайдзен / Lean Sigma, все получили сертификаты об завершение курсов. Так же сейчас в разработке уникальный курс по требованиям маркировки товаров, а именно сертификатов соответствия CE – (Европейский союз) и EAC (Евразийский Экономический Союз).ТШО постоянно проводит совместные мероприятия с нашими бизнес партнерами, сотрудничает с АкиматомАтырауской области, министерствами и ассоциациями по выявлению квалифицированных компаний для раннего выявления возможностей увеличения доли местного содержания.'",

On December 7, 2022, an award ceremony was held in Astana with the participation of the Republic of Kazakhstan (RoK) President - Qassym-Jomart Tokayev. Yerulan Zhamaubayev, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan, presented the Paryz award to TCO Deputy General Director - Konilkosh Suyessinov.  A special prize was awarded for the implementation of two voluntary programs in Atyrau Oblast: Egilik social infrastructure program and Community Investment Program (CIP). The organizers noted TCO’s contribution to the social and infrastructural development of Atyrau Oblast. TCO Community Investment Program was launched in 2010. During its implementation, 94 projects have been implemented over 11 years. In 2022, TCO invested $2.3 million for implementation of this program. Based on this, non-governmental organizations implemented 14 projects in Atyrau Oblast, including in Zhylyoi district. Among these projects, were Gulnaz Kosmurziyeva’s “Biz de adambyz” project, Yerlan Kumiskaliyev’s “Atyrau - Small Country”, and NGO Sezual under leadership of Kazakh scientist-inventor Galymzhan Gabdreshov, as well as a project called “Qogamdyq kenistikter” (Public Spaces) implemented by the Eurasia Foundation of Central Asia. A voluntary social infrastructure program “Egilik” with an annual budget of $25 million was first introduced in 1999 and its main objective is construction of socially significant facilities in Atyrau Oblast, such as schools, kindergartens, hospitals and much more. Over the years of implementation of the program, more than 100 facilities have been built, thanks to which more than 3,000 additional jobs have been created. This year, the central stadium was opened in Kulsary, Zhylyoi district with a capacity of up to 3,000 seats.  “One of TCO priorities is to improve well-being of the region in which we live and work. And Zhylyoi district occupies a special place, because over 10 000 of our employees and their families live here, about 40 contracting organizations are also registered in this area”, - noted Darmen Aronov TCO General Manager of Policy, Government and Public Affairs. “10 of 14 projects carried out by our NGO partners are implemented in Zhylyoi district. I would especially like to note the successful achievement of our partners – a special hippotherapy program for children in Kulsary is beginning to make progress. In addition more than 30 recreation spaces were built by the village residents themselves within framework of “Public Spaces” – and these are not the only examples we can mention.”'",
  "new_2_text": "'October 27, 2022, ATYRAU – Tengizchevroil (TCO) and North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) held a “Women in Energy: Pushing the Limits” Forum in Atyrau. The forum was organized to promote gender diversity and inclusion in the still male-dominated oil and gas industry, to share ideas and company initiatives offering more opportunities for women to step into leadership roles and pursue their goals. Numerous research and statistics have proven that workplaces prioritizing diversity and inclusion create safer, harmonic, and more productive work environments and, as a result, a better-performing company. During the forum, professionals voiced what it takes to promote females into senior roles in the energy sector in Kazakhstan. What barriers are still in place, are they real or perceived? At TCO 30% of the workforce are female, in the Leadership Team, 30% are women that are responsible for the most critical work in our organization. Overall, from Field Facilities to Gas Injection, from Facilities Engineering to Marketing and Transportation women play an essential role in operational, technological, scientific, and engineering parts of our business. Compared to 2011, share of women in middle management roles increased for 7%.  Currently, women represent around 30% of almost 3,000 employees in NCOC. Nearly half of them are professionals with a technical background working equally alongside NCOC male workers to make the company successful. During the event, government representatives, top management of NCOC and TCO, female leaders of the oil and gas industry, and special guests joining online shared practical experiences on professional development and personal growth of women, improving their competitiveness, balancing career and gender roles, pay gap and other issues relating to promoting capability.TCO General director, Kevin Lyon, stated: “I know we must continue to empower women to take their place in this dynamic sector. I am equally proud to support women within our own organization and across our member companies. I am confident, that women will play an increasing role not only in providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy but also in advancing the Kazakhstani Energy sector”. NCOC Managing director Olivier Lazare said that “To progress further we need the involvement of all, men and women, in the sustainable development of the industry. Gender balance is not only a good organizational practice, it also supports diversity in thoughts, experiences, knowledge, ideas, and perspectives. NCOC aims to be an organization where every voice matters and we are on a journey to become a more diverse and inclusive organization”. The forum has positioned itself as an effective platform for sharing experiences, building business partnerships in a wide range of areas, and facilitating the development of talents and skills advancing the career growth of women in the oil and gas and energy sectors.'",

The discussion was attended by: Pedro Miras, President of the World Petroleum Council (WPC), Burcu Günal, WPC Vice President for Finance, Turkey, Claire Gauthier-Watson, BCG Representative, USA, Maria Dotsenko, UN Women Representative in Kazakhstan, Madina Abylkassymova, Chairman, Financial Regulation Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Lyazzat Akhmurzina, Executive Director, KAZENERGY Association, Ksenia Babushkina, Partner, E&Y Kazakhstan, Sholpan Altybayeva, HR General Manager, Chevron Eurasia, Kamshat Baizhanova, Human Resources General Manager, Tengizchevroil (TCO), Zamzagul Bekova, TCO Finance General Manager, Aisha Turebayeva, Department Director of KazMunayGas JSC Today, 30% of middle managers at Tengizchevroil are women. Respect for diversity and inclusion is a core value at TCO, which is why the company is a leader in the energy industry in Kazakhstan with regards to the representation of women in leadership positions Zamzagul Bekova, TCO Finance General Manager, in her speech noted the difficulties and biases that women leaders still face: “The industry needs more women leaders in management positions: they need to be supported, promoted, helped to become more self-confident, so that they can participate in the company's decision-making. To do this, it is important to involve both female and male mentors. It is also important that women themselves learn to take charge of their fate, look for mentors themselves, initiate projects themselves, instead of sitting and waiting for support. It is necessary to be responsible not only for the work performed, but also for building a career and achieving success. Never give up and never stop moving forward. It should be noted that more than half of the female employees represented at TCO and recruitment agencies, namely 58%, work at Tengiz, while the rest are from offices of Atyrau. In addition, according to statistics, women are loyal and work in the company for about 12 years on average Kamshat Baizhanova, TCO Human Resources General Manager, emphasized: “Physical and mental security is a fundamental condition for gender equality. Women can develop, reveal their talents, be useful only when they are confident in their own wellbeing. The second important condition is the unity and awareness of society regarding the gender issue. When society understands that gender equality benefits everyone: the economy of the country, the success of companies, and the well-being of a family - then women will aspire to leadership positions. It is necessary not only to open the way for women to the labor market, but also to give them the opportunity to make decisions.”'",

The forum was attended by representatives of the State Policy Department in waste management of the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources (MEGNR) of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Ecology department of Atyrau Oblast, Natural Resources and Environmental Management of Atyrau Oblast Akimat, the European-Asian “green” economy Association, Kazakhstan Association for Waste Management “KazWaste”, international companies, as well as owners and managers of local companies in the area of waste disposal services Within the framework of the forum, the MEGNR specialists spoke about the requirements of the current environmental legislation applicable to organizations providing services in the production and consumption waste management. Meanwhile, TCO specialists discussed TCO’s internal requirements for potential business partners. Representatives of the association explained the national standards requirements for certain types of waste, while representatives of international companies spoke about international practices of production and consumption waste management “Waste management is an important component of the Republic of Kazakhstan’s transition concept to a “green economy.” As you know, TCO strives for continuous improvement in environmental performance. We are pleased that all of you support and stand for TCO values. Only through joint efforts can we achieve success in recycling and reuse of waste, at the same time providing employment to the local population, stimulating economic activity, as well as introducing high quality standards. All these actions will help build strong capabilities in this key area of Kazakhstan’s economy.” - TCO Deputy General Director - Konilkosh Suyessinov, emphasized in his welcoming speech, addressing the forum participants At Tengiz, which is located 160 km south-east of Atyrau, there is an industrial complex and about a hundred rotational villages, where thousands of workers from different regions of Kazakhstan live. As a result of TCO’s production activities and related infrastructure, 63 types of various waste streams are generated, and the company can successfully process over 35 of them independently or with the involvement of third-party organizations. During the period of 2015 - 2022, the volume of waste transfer for processing by third-party organizations amounted to more than 700,000 tons. TCO focused on waste recycling. For example, from 2016 to 2022, 2,259 tons of plastic bottles were transferred for processing from which other goods were produced using plastic and PET pellets. Approximately 5,861 tons of paper and cardboard were directed to the production of packaging materials and other goods, and 99,542 tons of concrete waste were used as construction material or transferred to third parties​ At all production sites, both in rotational camps and at other TCO facilities, special color-coded containers have been installed for the distribution of waste by category: plastic bottles, cardboard, office paper, glass, substandard metal, etc. In 2019, when compared to 2017, the sorting and transfer of plastic bottles increased by 11 times, which in mass amounted to over 700 tons, and transfer of cardboard for processing increased by 8 times, which in mass amounted to over 1,500 tons All generated waste from production and administrative sites of the field is transported to the Tengiz Eco Center (TEC) facility, which is a “Hub” for the management of waste. This modern multifunctional waste management facility, which was launched in 2004, is the main point where waste is safely received, distributed, temporarily stored, and disposed of on a territory of about 100 hectares TCO constantly monitors the market of potential suppliers and studies available waste management methods to further expand waste processing capacities. These efforts will allow the company to achieve even improvements in waste management performance. This will help TCO to continue supporting green principles outlined by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, remain in compliance with the regulatory requirements as well as align with international standards. It is particularly important that all participants in the process have the necessary qualifications and competence. TCO strives to develop and maintain strong business relationships with client-oriented suppliers who have a strong safety culture, uninterrupted production, cost management skills, innovative business solutions and who offer quality goods and services at competitive prices. TCO is convinced that sustainable local companies that actively contribute to sustainable development benefit the economy, society, and the country in general.'",
  "new_7_text": "On September 1, 2022, a new expedition within the Caspian Seal Population Conservation Project started; it includes the collection of ghost fishing nets and marine debris on the coast and in the Mangistau Bay. The project is implemented by the Institute of Hydrobiology and Ecology with the financial support of Tengizchevroil and aims to protect and promote the growth of the population of endangered marine species, such as the Caspian seal and the Sturgeon species (Acipenseridae family). August 27, 2022, a briefing in the Center for Public Communications of Mangistau Oblast was held. Also, there was a meeting on the collection of marine debris and research on its impact on the biodiversity of the Caspian Sea in the Department of Fisheries of Mangistau Oblast. The 2019–2021 research and practice found that the shores of the islands and Tubkaragan Peninsula are experiencing heavy pollution from ghost fishing nets, plastic debris, including microplastics The purpose of the work in 2022 is to survey and clean the northern coast of the Tubkaragan Peninsula and the adjacent water area of the Mangistau Bay from ghost fishing nets and debris, as an important measure to restore the Seal Islands as a habitat for the Caspian seal and stabilize their population Collection of fishing nets and marine debris is conducted from September 1 to 20, 2022, under the Caspian Seal Population Conservation Project, with the financial support of Tengizchevroil. The project to be implemented by the Institute of Hydrobiology and Ecology. The EcoMangistau NGO and EcoWestAktau LLP will also be involved in the activities The results of a survey of seal carcasses and remains found on the west coast of the Tubkaragan Peninsula conducted in the fall of 2019 showed that fishing nets are responsible for most seal deaths Surveys in 2020 confirmed that Kulaly Island is the most polluted area on Seal Islands, where many nets (61.8%) are drifted ashore and dumped among the four surveyed islands - Podgorny, Morskoy, Rybachy, Kulaly. Consequently, Kulaly Island serves as a “receiver” of ghost fishing nets for sturgeon species. In 2021 alone, 5,377 kg of marine debris was collected on this island, where approximately 80% is represented by ghost fishing nets, most of the nets are large mesh, for catching sturgeon species. In total, since 2014, when the project was first supported by Tengizchevroil, 878 ghost fishing nets (20,500 kg) and more than 9,000 kg of marine debris have been retrieved from the Caspian Sea, with 53 sturgeon and 15 seals released from ghost nets. Scientific research to study the distribution of microplastics in the ecosystem of the Mangystau Bay and fish species living there - potential food for the Caspian seal will be continued this year The diversity of the Western Kazakhstan ecosystem provides ecological, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic value and plays an important role in the sustainable development of Tengizchevroil. The Company also provides financial support to the Kazakhstan Biodiversity Conservation Association (KBCA) to implement a program to protect the nests of the Sociable Plover, a bird listed as endangered by the BirdLife International (form. IUCN). In addition, to achieve sturgeon growth, TCO supports the Ural-Atyrau Sturgeon Hatchery by providing them with quality feed for the breeding stock and fry, as well as by acquiring aerators for oxygenation of rearing ponds and an excavator for external dredging work on the farm's ponds ",

  "new_9_text": "On December 21, non-governmental organizations spoke in front of Akimat representatives, community, beneficiaries, as well as project sponsors in Kulsary by sharing their results achieved under the 2022 TCO Community Investment Program (CIP).\n\nThe Community Investment Program is one of TCO’s voluntary programs, which along with “Egilik” Voluntary Social Infrastructure Program is being implemented within the territory of Atyrau Oblast and Zhylyoi region in particular. It was launched back in 2010. Since then, year-end meetings have become an annual tradition, where NGOs tell the public their success stories, challenges, ups and downs as well as share their experiences with other NGOs who come to the event as guests.\n\nThis year, the reporting meeting changed its format and expanded its geography and audience. So, it was decided to hold two events: one of them in Kulsary for the Zhylyoi region community, and the second in the format of an open festival in Atyrau on December 23. The event was also accompanied by creative performances of the beneficiaries and participants of the Community Investment Program.\n\nIn his welcoming speech, Deputy Akim of Zhylyoi region, Anuar Shakirov noted and thanked each NGO for their work: “Such a large company as TCO is implementing Community Investment Program focused on improving various spheres of life, and it is good that 10 out of 14 projects are being implemented in Zhylyoi region. These projects covered not only Kulsary but also the remote villages of our district. More than 25 mini-projects have been implemented within CIP. The activities of NGOs have been actively covered in all the media and social networks, and we all know what a great job they have done. I want to highlight that last year, a resident of Kulsary was trained within “Algyr” project under the CIP and implemented her own project - this is an excellent result. I would like to wish to our residents and NGOs to be more active, so that more similar projects are implemented next year in our region”    \n\nProjects with direct influence and participation in the lives of Kulsary residents were presented in Kulsary. One of them is everyone’s favorite project “Public Spaces” implemented by the Eurasia Foundation of Central Asia. Residents of villages and towns build recreational facilities, playgrounds, and sports grounds, and provide street lighting with their hands - in one word, they improve the territory of their community. 3.5 million tenge is allocated for each project. And this year 27 mini-projects were implemented in Zhylyoi region which brought benefit to more than 8,000 people. In addition, the geography of this project covers Borankul village in Mangistau Oblast where 5 projects were implemented.“The uniqueness of the Community Investment Program is that the public represented by NGOs, knowing what areas need improvement, proposes projects for implementation. The work of our NGO partners influences a lot of people of different ages, genders, and social statuses” said Darmen Aronov, TCO Policy, Government and Public Affairs General Manager.\n\nLearn more about each project at: https://tcocip.kz/  \n\nThe Community Investment Program has been implemented since 2010.

Currently, there are 55 people undergoing rehabilitation programs. \n\nAs mentioned by the Head of Atyrau Oblast department for coordination of employment, social programs Azamat Mambetov, this equipment is of great importance for the rehabilitation center: “Today, thanks to the sponsorship of TCO, the new equipment has been transferred to Atyrau Regional Rehabilitation Center. It is essential for a center that serves up to 1,000 people annually. I hope that it will be useful and contribute to the speedy recovery of our citizens.” \n\nIn total, TCO donated 9 items of equipment designed to improve the motor skills of the musculoskeletal system for patients after stroke, etc.\n\nThe company expressed its hope that this equipment will have a positive impact on the recovery of the rehabilitation center's patients. \n\n“The center is visited by residents from all over Atyrau Oblast, and we hope that our support will have a positive impact on the quick recovery of visitors. TCO, as a socially responsible company, has always sought to provide social support in the region where it conducts its production activities. Over the years, the company has allocated $2.6 billion for the implementation of socially significant projects.”, - said Asset Kurmanbayev, TCO Legal Department General Manager. \n\nIt should be noted that this year the patients of the rehabilitation center also attended hippotherapy classes at “Atyrau. Small country” Public Fund. In 2022, the fund received financial support under TCO Community Investments Program. As the Head of “Atyrau. Small country” Yerlan Kumiskaliyev notes the patients are making significant progress.
